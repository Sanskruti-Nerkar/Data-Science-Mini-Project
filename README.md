# 🕵 Crime Data Analysis and Case Closure Prediction

##  Overview
This mini-project focuses on analyzing crime data and predicting the likelihood of a criminal case being **closed** or **remaining open**.  
By applying **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models**, the project uncovers key factors influencing case outcomes and provides valuable insights for law enforcement and policy planning.

---

##  Project Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** to handle missing, duplicate, and inconsistent records.  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify crime trends across cities, genders, and domains.  
- Build **classification models** to predict case closure status.  
- Apply **regression models** to predict operational parameters like *Police Deployed*.  
- Use **clustering algorithms** to identify hidden crime patterns.  
- Evaluate and compare model performance using standard metrics.

##  Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values:** Filled using mode or constant values (`Unknown` for categorical data).  
- **Duplicates:** Removed duplicate records.  
- **Encoding:** Used **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical features.  
- **Scaling:** Applied **StandardScaler** for numerical features.  
- **Pipeline:** Combined all preprocessing steps using a `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` for efficient model training.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to identify relationships and patterns within the data:
- Distribution of crimes across cities and domains.  
- Victim demographics (age and gender).  
- Relationship between police deployment and closure rate.  
- Trends over time (by week and month of reporting).  
- Correlation heatmaps and visualization of inter-feature relationships.

Key visualizations:
- Countplots for categorical variables  
- Boxplots and histograms for numerical distributions  
- Pie charts for city-wise case closures  
- Scatter plots for relationships (e.g., Victim Age vs Police Deployed)

- Accuracy: **~0.78**
- Best Predictors: `Crime Domain`, `City`, `Weapon Used`, `Police Deployed`, and `Victim Age`.

**Sample Output:**
| Actual | Predicted |
|--------|------------|
| Yes | Yes |
| No | No |
| Yes | Yes |
| No | Yes |
| No | No |

###  **Regression Prediction**
**Goal:** Predict continuous values such as `Police Deployed` and `Victim Age`.  
**Best Model:** Linear Regression  
**Performance:**
| Target | R² Score | MAE | MSE |
|---------|-----------|-----|-----|
| Police Deployed | **0.80** | 1.22 | 2.85 |
| Crime Code | 0.70 | 1.51 | 3.24 |

|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Cluster 0 | Urban, weapon-related, high closure rate | Violent crimes |
| Cluster 1 | Rural, low deployment, low closure | Petty crimes |
| Cluster 2 | Cyber or financial crimes | Delayed closure |
| Cluster 3 | Balanced profile | Mixed-category crimes |
